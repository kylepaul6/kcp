                            <article>
                            This website was designed to showcase my creative work, ranging from my musical creations, architectural drawings, and coding experience. 
                            </article>
                        </div>

                            <h3>How It Started</h3>
                            <img src="images/code.png" style="float: right">
                            <article class="article1">
                                
                            It started as an idea for a project - I wanted to combine my artistic interests in music and architecture in one all encompassing platform. After taking an introductory Python course - which was brutal to say the least - I found an interest in computer science. From there, I purchased a few online courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It became something of a hobby. I followed along with these courses and implemented what I learned to create what you are looking at now. 
                            
                            
                            </article>
                            
                      
                            <h3>How I Made My First Page</h3>
                            
                            <article class="article">
                            Beginning with an <em>index.html</em>, I put together a format that I would stick with for every other page on the website. As you see now, the color scheme I decided on was a soft blue and gray. The thing is, I did not think about responsive web-design. After a quick web search, I discovered CSS Grid, and found the perfect grid layout for this project.

                            <img src="images/code2.png" style="float: right">
                      
                            <h3>Next Steps </h3>
                            <article>
                            I then copy&pasted this general format on the other pages. The navigation bar on the top section of the website is present on every page because nothing is more frustrating than having the navigate using harder-to-find links somewhere else on the page. Likewise, the color sheme is present on each page to have a cohesive website.

                            <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                            <article>
                            This website is quite simple - there is no "server", no place to search, input, or interact in any way. For this, I anticipate learning JavaScript and BootStrap.

                            <h3>Final Note</h3>
                            <article>The last thing I would like to say is I appreciate any input you may have. Any collaboration is welcome.
