                            This website is designed to showcase my creative work, including musical creations, architectural drawings, and coding experience.

                            <h3>How It Started</h3>
                            <img src="images/code.png" style="float: right">
                            <article class="article1">
                                
                            It started as an idea for a project - I wanted to combine my artistic interests in music and architecture in one all encompassing platform. After taking an introductory Python course, I found an interest in computer science. From there, I purchased a few online courses in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It became something of a hobby. I followed along with these courses and implemented what I learned to create what you are looking at now.

                            <br><br>
                            <h3>How I Made My First Page</h3>
                            
                            <article class="article">
                            Beginning with an <em>index.html</em>, I had originally intended to have a 3-column layout with alternating blues and grays, but it felt bleak and outdated. From there came the idea to create a more modern page with a row-oriented view as opposed to columns. In each row, I added a <em>background-image: url("...")</em> CSS format with different images for each section. The color scheme I decided on was <strong>#f4f8ff</strong> (blue) and <strong>#e2e2e2</strong> (gray) which appear in the absence of images.

                            <img src="images/code2.png" style="float: right">
                            <br><br>
                            
                            <h3>Next Steps </h3>
                            <article>
                            I then copy&pasted this general format on the other pages. The navigation bar on the top section of the website is present on every page because nothing is more frustrating than having the navigate using harder-to-find links somewhere else on the page. Using a <em>@media query</em>, I added a responsive navigation bar that has position <em>left:-100%</em>; CSS parameter. Once the menu button on the top right is clicked, the new, vertical navigation bar moves to <em>left: 0</em>; with a .5s transition. 
                            <br><br>
                            The most difficult aspect for me has been responsiveness. Using the new navigation bar has made things easier as I use the same format for each page. However, certain aspects of responsiveness have been difficult to grasp, such as image size and position once that page is shrunk or increased.

                            <h3>Looking Forward</h3>
                            <article>
                            This website is quite simple - there is no "server", no place to search, input, or interact in any way. For this, I anticipate learning JavaScript and BootStrap. To list a few of my goals, I hope next to include a search bar in the top right corner, make the website more responsive to work on cell phones and tablets, and add some more subtle animations, such as slightly altering the size and zoom of an image when it is hovered over. Further, I wish to make this website have more "dry" code. In the building of this website, I noticed a lot of different .html files and .css files, even though I <em><link>'d</em> all the .html files to my <em>style.css</em> file.
